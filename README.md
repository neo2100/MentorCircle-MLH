# MentorCircle-MLH
MentorCircle project is an MVP for Back to Hacking event in MLH 2021.

## Inspiration
Are you a early talent who struggles to navigate and progress in your career journey? 
Do you feel intimidating signing up for a mentorship program not knowing what you should do? 
Do you ever struggle to find a mentor who connects with your experience and advices you into the right path? 

Don't worry, MentorCircle is here for you. 

MentorCircle is inspired by a roundtable conversation among early talents. The founders empathized by everyone's journey and inspired to create a robust mentorship network. Instead of a define role of mentor or mentee, we are a bigger believer in creating a open roundtable for peers to share what they excel in and seek guidance on what they need. 

With MentorCircle as the centralize mentorship resource hub, you will be able to build a tailored career network with little downtime and only a few click away.

## What it does

MentorCircle is a professional social networking platform design to create a virtual mentorship roundtable among college graduates and early industry talents. 

Users can sign up and set up their profile outlining their experience and mentorship expectation they are seeking for. Once the profile is set up, the algorithm will recommend and pre-match connections that suit best to the users profile. 

To engage knowledge sharing and transfer, there is a point system to encourage contribution. User can earn points through mentoring others, answering open forum questions or participating in activities etc. 

In order to participating in an one on one mentorship, user will have to collect sufficient points to do so. Mentees can submit request to begin a mentorship with their desired mentor with a simple application. There will be recommended prompt and guidance for mentors and mentees to reference to during the process. Additional post mentorship functionality such as reference letter template and custom feedback summary are also available to create action plans and journal the learnings in the mentorship. 

## How we built it
Our project was an output of one full round of design thinking and MVP implementation. We started by brainstorming on the problem statement and then exploring the solution space using Mural. Then using Figma we started to build an interactive UX prototype. 

## Challenges we ran into
Here are a couple challenges we ran into:

<ul>
  <li> **Prototyping under 48 hours:** Our team had lots of interesting idea to implement, but given we have to work around with international time zone.  </li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
  <li>Fourth item</li>
</ul>

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy that we are able to complete the idea of MentorCircle under 48 hours and challenging time zone. With the pressure we are working under, our team is proud that we are ready to present the first prototype and ideation. 

## What we learned



## What's next for MentorCircle
We hope to seek for continue progression and support on MentorCircle. The next of this will be delveloping a beta functional webiste and application.
